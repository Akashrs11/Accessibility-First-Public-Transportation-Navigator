# Accessibility-First-Public-Transportation-Navigator
Public transportation can be really difficult to use for people with disabilities. Elevators may not work, stations can be crowded, and thereâ€™s often no clear information about accessible entrances or routes. Our team wants to solve this by creating a navigation app that focuses on accessibility first.
