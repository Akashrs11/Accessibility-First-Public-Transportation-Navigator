# Accessibility-First-Public-Transportation-Navigator
Public transportation can be complicated to use for people with disabilities. Elevators may not
work, stations can be crowded, and there’s often no clear information about accessible
entrances or routes. Our team wants to solve this by creating a navigation app that focuses on
accessibility first. The idea is to help users with mobility, visual, or cognitive disabilities travel
more confidently using public transport. The app will offer custom routes based on accessibility
needs, real-time updates on things like elevator outages or crowd levels, and allow users to
share helpful information with the community. This way, we hope to make transit more
inclusive and stress-free for everyone. One of the key features will be a community contribution
system, where users can share and verify accessibility-related information to help others. We
believe that public transport should be inclusive for everyone, and our goal is to build a tool
that reduces uncertainty and empowers people with disabilities to navigate cities more
comfortably and confidently.
